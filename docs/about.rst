The source and issue tracker for Curtsies are on `Github <https://github.com/bpython/curtsies>`_.

A good place to ask questions about Curtsies is `#bpython on irc.freenode.net <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bpython>`_.

Authors
=======

Curtsies was written by `Thomas Ballinger <http://ballingt.com>`_ to create
a frontend for `bpython <http://bpython-interpreter.org/>`_ that preserved terminal history.
