Window Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. automodule:: curtsies.window

Windows successively render 2D grids of text (usually instances of :py:class:`~curtsies.FSArray`)
to the terminal.

A window owns its output stream - it is assumed (but not enforced) that no additional data is written to this stream between renders,
an assumption which allows for example portions of the screen which do not change between renderings not to be redrawn during a rendering.

There are two useful window classes, both subclasses of :py:class:`~curtsies.window.BaseWindow`. :py:class:`~curtsies.FullscreenWindow`
renders to the terminal's `alternate screen buffer <https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#The%20Alternate%20Screen%20Buffer>`_
(no history preserved, like command line tools ``Vim`` and ``top``)
while :py:class:`~curtsies.CursorAwareWindow` renders to the normal screen.
It is also is capable of querying the terminal for the cursor location,
and uses this functionality to detect how a terminal moves
its contents around during a window size change.
This information can be used to compensate for
this movement and prevent the overwriting of history on the terminal screen.

Window Objects - Example
========================

    >>> from curtsies import FullscreenWindow, fsarray
    >>> import time
    >>> with FullscreenWindow() as win:
    ...     win.render_to_terminal(fsarray([u'asdf', u'asdf']))
    ...     time.sleep(1)
    ...     win.render_to_terminal(fsarray([u'asdf', u'qwer']))
    ...     time.sleep(1)

Window Objects - Context
========================

:py:meth:`~curtsies.window.BaseWindow.render_to_terminal` should only be called within the context
of a window. Within the context of an instance of :py:class:`~curtsies.window.BaseWindow`
it's important not to write to the stream the window is using (usually ``sys.stdout``).
Terminal window contents and even cursor position are assumed not to change between renders.
Any change that does occur in cursor position is attributed to movement of content
in response to a window size change and is used to calculate how this content has moved,
which is necessary because this behavior differs between terminal emulators.

Entering the context of a :py:class:`~curtsies.FullscreenWindow` object hides the cursor and switches to
the alternate terminal screen. Entering the context of a :py:class:`~curtsies.CursorAwareWindow` hides
the cursor, turns on cbreak mode, and records the cursor position. Leaving the context
does more or less the inverse.
